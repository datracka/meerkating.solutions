# TODO

## State

I want to build a quick and professional Landing Page. 
I want to do that using builder.io. Becuase it can be done fast / visually and I can learn for other projects
I am adding builder in the Astro / React project I built. 
This project has also a 50% i18n integration that (as usual) does not work either.

# Tasks

- [ ] Make a better way to build a landing page
  - [ ] Adding builder.io: It works but I don't know exactly why is not working the way builder.io recommends.  
- [ ] Add translation support
  - [ ] When requesting root route (<domain>/) it should redirect to the proper path "/en" or "/es" based on browser configuration. Now it is always redirecting to /en. Somehow a redirection happens automatically BUT always to english regardless the Browser language (that browser properly sets) and using only the defaultLanguage in Astro configuration.
- [ ] Add Logo
- [ ] Remove Menu
- [ ] Change Corporate Colors
- [ ] Add Services
- [ ] Add Form
