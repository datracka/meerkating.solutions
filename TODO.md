# TODO

- [ ] Add translation support
  - [ ] When requesting root route (<domain>/) it should redirect to the proper path "/en" or "/es" based on browser configuration. Now it is always redirecting to /en. Somehow a redirection happens automatically BUT always to english regardless the Browser language (that browser properly sets) and using only the defaultLanguage in Astro configuration.
